class ConnectionState:
    """State of a connection to the gateway.

    This was made to detach meaningful state from the actual
    :class:`Connection` object. Since the connection will be
    closed sooner or later, its state will be lost on disconnect.
    
    When reconnecing, we'll need to restore the old state to the connection,
    and the old approach(of making a dict as the state) was a bad idea in my opinion.

    All :class:`Connection` code that requires connection state uses :class:`ConnectionState`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    session_id: str
        Session ID this state refers to.
    token: str
        Token that this state refers to.
    user: :class:`User`
        User that this state refers to.

    shard_id: int
        Shard ID of this state.
    shard_count: int
        Shard count of this state.
    sharded: bool
        If this state refers to a shard

    events: `collections.deque[dict]`
        Deque of sent events to the connection. Used for resuming
        This is filled up when the connection receives a dispatched event

    recv_seq: int
        Last sequence number received by the client.
    sent_seq: int
        Last sequence number dispatched to the client.
